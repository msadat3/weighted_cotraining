## Dataset Description
This directory contains the human annotated training data for scientific NLI, constructed in our ACL 2024 paper: [Co-training for Low Resource Scientific Natural Language Inference](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.139/)

We derive the human annotated tranining data for scientific NLI from the [SciNLI](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.511/) training set which was constructed by automatically annotating sentence pairs extracted from the papers published in the ACL anthology on NLP and computational linguistics. 

Each file in this directory contains 1000 human annotated sentence pairs. That is, we release a human annotated training set containing 2000 examples for scientific NLI.
